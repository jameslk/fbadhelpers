# fbadhelpers

This library is a collection of helper utilities for consuming the
Facebook Marketing API. It utilizes static typing to clarify expectations
and mostly assumes a function-driven paradigm to simplify usage. A lot
of the API is built for specific needs since I'm just using this library
internally between several projects. For this reason, there may be plenty
of API thrashing and various untested code paths (i.e. this library is
meant for "educational purposes" only). I have not published this package
to PyPI for that reason.
